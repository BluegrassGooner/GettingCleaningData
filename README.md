Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The run_analysis.R code takes the various txt files provided in the UCI HAR Dataset (excluding the Inertial Signals) and constructs a large data frame combining the test and train subsets of observations. Next the code, removes all variables that do not deal with mean and standard deviation calculations and produces a tidy data set that contains only the average of those variables for each activity and each subject.
